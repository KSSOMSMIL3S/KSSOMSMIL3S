**Overview**

This public webpage was created to share my on-going `projects` in my HomeLab centre. Also sharing my certification tree, and continuing education. I do hope that I can stay on track with all my projects and initiatives in-between my studies ~~and getting pawned in valorant bronze lobbies.~~

If you want to join me in my gaming sessions, hit me up on the100.io LFG website [here](https://youtu.be/sXwaRjU7Tj0) or join me on discord [here](https://youtu.be/sXwaRjU7Tj0)
